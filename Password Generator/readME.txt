Hello

We face this common problem of trying to rememeber passwords for many different websites which we use 
from time to time. This program tries to solve the problem by:

- Generating strong passwords(containing alpha-numeric and special characters).
- The generated passwords are saved in .json format along with the Username and website details.
- The saved records can be easily accessed.
